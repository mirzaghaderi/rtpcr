# Overview

iqpcr is a package for statistical analysis and graphical presentation of real-time PCR (quantitative PCR  or qPCR) data. Various analysis methods are employed to real-time PCR data to measure the mRNA levels under different experimental conditions. iqpcr handles amplification efficiency calculation and statistical analysis of real-time PCR data based on one reference gene. By accounting for amplification efficiendcy values, iqpcr was developed using a general calculation method described by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1949-5">Ganger et al. 2017</a>., covering both the Livak and Pfaffl methods. Based on the experimental conditions, the functions of the iqpcr package use t-test (for experiments with a two-level factor) or analysis of variance (for cases where more than two levels or factors exists) to calculate the fold change or relative expression. The functions further provide standard deviations and confidence limits for means, appliy statistical mean comparisons and present letter mean grouping. To facilitate functions application, different dataset have been used in the examples and the outputs are explaines. An outstanding feature of iqpcr package is providing publication-ready bar plots with various controling arguments for experiments with up to three different factors. The iqpcr package is user friendly and easy to work with and provide an applicable resource for analysing real-time PCR data in R.

# Calculation methods
Among the various approaches developed for data analysis in real-time PCR, the Livak method, also known as the $2^{-\Delta\Delta C_t}$ method, stands out for its simplicity and widespread use. 


$$\begin{align*}
\text{Fold change} & = 2^{-\Delta\Delta C_t} \\
& = \frac{2^{-(C_{t_{\text{target}}}-C_{t_{\text{ref}}})_{Tr}}}
{2^{-(C_{t_{\text{target}}}-C_{t_{\text{ref}}})_{Co}}} \\ 
& =2^{-[(C_{t_{\text{target}}}-C_{t_{\text{ref}}})_{\text{Tr}}-
{(C_{t_{\text{target}}}-C_{t_{\text{ref}}})}_{\text{Co}}]} \\ 
& = 2^{-[{(\Delta C_t)_{Tr} - (\Delta C_t)_{Co}}]}
\end{align*}$$


where Tr is Treatment and Co is Control conditions, respectively. This method assumes that both the target and reference genes are amplified with efficiencies close to 100%, allowing for the relative quantification of gene expression levels¹.

On the other hand, the Pfaffl method offers a more flexible approach by accounting for differences in amplification efficiencies between the target and reference genes. This method adjusts the calculated expression ratio by incorporating the specific amplification efficiencies, thus providing a more accurate representation of the relative gene expression levels².

$$\text{Fold change} = \frac{E^{-(C_{t_{\text{Tr}}}-C_{t_{\text{Co}}})_{target}}}
{E^{-(C_{t_{\text{Tr}}}-C_{t_{\text{Co}}})_{ref}}}$$

# A generalized calculation method
the iqpcr packager  calculates wDCt values for each experimental conditions based on the efficiency and Ct values as described by Ganger et al. (2017).


$$w\Delta Ct =\log_{10}(E_{target}).Ct_{target}-\log_{10}(E_{ref}).Ct_{ref}$$
if wDCt values is calculated using the efficiencies (E) values, calculations matches the formula of Pfaffl. if 2 (100% amplification efficiency) is used, calculations matches the formula of Livak. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and ttest (paired or unpaired) is done on the wDCt values. Subsequently, mean of wCt over each condition along with the resulting statistics (e.g. confidence limits for the means) is converted by a power of ten conversion for presentation. For example relative expression is calculated as:
$$\text{Relative Expression} = 10^{-\overline{w\Delta Ct}}$$
When there are only two conditions (Tr and Co), fold change can also be calculated:
$$\text{Fold Change}=10^{-(\overline{w\Delta Ct}_{\text{Tr}}-{\overline{w\Delta Ct}_{\text{Co}}})}$$

`iqpcr` is a CRAN package and can be installed through `install.packages()`.
```{r eval= F, include= T, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
install.packages("iqpcr")
library(iqpcr)
```

The development version of the `iqpcr` package can be obtained through: 
```{r eval= F, include= T, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# install `iqpcr` from github (under development)
devtools::install_github("mirzaghaderi/iqpcr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

# Amplification efficiency data analysis
## Sample data of amplification efficiency

In order to calculate the amplification efficiencies
of a target and a reference gene, a dataframe should be prepared with 3 columns 
of dilutions, target gene Ct values, and reference gene Ct values, respectively, 
as shown below.

```{r eval= T}
data_efficiency
```

## Calculating amplification efficiency
The following `efficiency` function calculates amplification efficiency of a target and a
reference gene, and present the related standard curves along with the Slope, Efficiency, and R2 statistics. The function also compares the slopes of the two standard curves. For this, a regression line is fitted using the $\Delta C_t$ values. If $2^{-\Delta\Delta C_t}$ method is intended, the slope should not exceed 0.2!

```{r eval = T, fig.height = 3, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Standard curve and the amplification efficiency analysis of target and reference genes.', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
efficiency(data_efficiency)
```

# Expression data analysis

## Target genes in two conditions (t-test)

### Example data
when a target gene is assessed under two different conditions (for example Control and treatment), it is possible to calculate the average fold change expression i.e. $2^{-\Delta \Delta C_t}$ of the target gene in treatment relative to control conditions. For this, the data should be prepared according to the following dataset consisting of 4 columns belonging to condition levels, E (efficiency), genes and Ct values, respectively. Each Ct value is the mean of technical replicates. Complete amplification efficiencies of 2 have been assumed here for all wells but the calculated efficiencies can be used instead. 

```{r eval= T, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5, fig.align = 'center'}
data_ttest
```

### Data analysis under two conditions

Here, the above data set was used for the Fold Change expression analysis of the target genes using the `qpcrTTEST` function. This function performs a t.test based analysis to any number of genes that 
have been evaluated under control and treatment conditions. The analysis can be done for unpaired or paired condition. The output is a table of target gene names, fold changes confidence limits and the t.test derived p-values. The `qpcrTTEST` function include the `var.equal` argument. When set to `FALSE`,
`t.test` is performed under unequal variances hypothesis.

```{r eval= T}
qpcrTTEST(data_ttest, paired = F, var.equal = T)
```


### Generating plot
`qpcrTTESTplot` function generates a bar plot of Fold Changes and confidence intervals for the target genes. the `qpcrTTESTplot` function accepts any gene name and any replicates. `qpcrTTESTplot` function automatically put appropriate signs of **, * on top of the plot columns based on the output p-values.


```{r eval= T, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Average Fold changes of three target genes relative to the control condition computed by unpaired t-tests. Error bars represent 95% confidence interval.", warning = F, message = F}

# Producing the plot
qpcrTTESTplot(data_ttest)

# Producing the plot: specifying gene order
qpcrTTESTplot(data_ttest,
   order = c("C2H2-01", "C2H2-12", "C2H2-26"),
   paired = FALSE,
   var.equal = TRUE,
   width = 0.5,
   fill = "skyblue",
   y.axis.adjust = 0,
   y.axis.by = 2,
   ylab = "Average Fold Change",
   xlab = "Gene")
```

## A target gene under more than two conditions (ANOVA)

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of factorial experiments in the frame of a completely randomized design (CRD) can be done by the `qpcrANOVA` function. ANOVA of qPCR data is suitable when there is a factor with more than two levels, or when there are more than a experimental factor. The input data set should be prepared as shown below. Factor columns should be presented first followed by biological replicates and efficiency and Ct values of target and reference genes. The example data set below (`data_3factor_a`) represents amplification efficiency and Ct values for target and reference genes under three grouping factors (two different cultivars, three drought levels and the presence or absence of bacteria). The table can contain any number of factor columns. The factor columns, should be followed by five other columns assigned to biological replicates (r), efficiency of the target gene, Ct values of target gene, efficiency of reference gene, and Ct values of the reference gene, respectively. Here, the efficiency of 2 has been used for all wells, but the calculated efficiencies can be used instead.


```{r eval= T}
# See a sample dataset
data_3factor_a
```

`qpcrANOVA` function performs  anova based on both factorial arrangement and completely randomized design (CRD). For the latter, a column of treatment combinations is made first as grouping factor followed by ANOVA. You can call the input data set along with the added wCt and treatment combinations by `qpcrANOVA(data_3factor_a)$Final_data`. CRD based analysis is especially useful when post-hoc test and mean comparisons/grouping is desired for all treatment combinations. The final results along with the ANOVA tables can be called by `qpcrANOVA(data_3factor_a)`.

### Reverse ordering of the grouping letters

One may be interested to present the statistical mean comparison result in the frame of grouping letters. This is rather challenging because in the grouping output of mean comparisons (via `LSD.test` function of agricolae package), means are sorted into descending order so that the largest mean, is the first in the
table and "a" letter is assigned to it. If `LSD.test` is applied to the wCt means,
the biggest wCt mean receive "a" letter as expected, but this value turns into
the smallest mean after its reverse log transformation by  $10^{-(\Delta Ct)}$. to solve
this issue, I used a function that assigns the grouping letters appropriately.

### Output table of the analysis

The `qpcrANOVA` function produces the main analysis output 
including mean wDCt, LCL, UCL, grouping letters and standard deviations. The
standard deviation for each mean is derived from the back transformed raw wDCt values from biological
replicates for that mean.

```{r eval= T, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
# If the data include technical replicates, means of technical replicates
# should be calculated first using meanTech function.

# Applying ANOVA analysis
qpcrANOVA(data_3factor_a, p.adj = "none")
```

### Barplot with the (1-alpha)% confidence interval as error bars

```{r eval= T, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Average relative expression of a target gene under two different factors of genotype (with two levels) and drought (with three levels). Error bars represent standard deviations. Means (columns) lacking letters in common have significant difference at alpha = 0.05 as resulted from the `LSD.test` of agricolae package."}
# Before plotting, the result needs to be extracted as below:
res <- qpcrANOVA(data_2factor)$Result
res

# Plot of the 'res' data with 'Genotype' as grouping factor
twoFACTORplot(res,
   x.axis.factor = Drought,
   group.factor = Genotype,
   width = 0.5,
   fill = "Greens",
   y.axis.adjust = 0.5,
   y.axis.by = 2,
   ylab = "Relative Expression",
   xlab = "Drought Levels",
   legend.position = c(0.09, 0.8),
   show.letters = TRUE)

# Plotting the same data with 'Drought' as grouping factor
twoFACTORplot(res,
   x.axis.factor = Genotype,
   group.factor = Drought,
   xlab = "Genotype",
   fill = "Blues",
   show.letters = FALSE)
```


### A three-factorial experiment example
```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Average relative expression of a target gene under three different conditions with two, two and three levels. Error bars can be standard deviation or confidence interval. Means lacking letters in common have significant difference at alpha = 0.05 resulted from the `LSD.test` of agricolae package."}
# Before plotting, the result needs to be extracted as below:
res <- qpcrANOVA(data_3factor_b)$Result
res

# Arrange the first three colunms of the result table.
# This determines the columns order and shapes the plot output.
threeFACTORplot(res,
    arrangement = c(3, 1, 2),
    legend.position = c(0.9, 0.85),
    xlab = "condition")



threeFACTORplot(res,
   arrangement = c(1, 2, 3),
   bar.width = 0.5,
   fill = "Greys",
   xlab = "Genotype",
   ylab = "Relative Expression")


# releveling a factor levels first
res$Conc <- factor(res$Conc, levels = c("L","M","H"))
res$Type <- factor(res$Type, levels = c("S","R"))

# Producing the plot
threeFACTORplot(res,
   arrangement = c(2, 3, 1),
   bar.width = 0.5,
   fill = "Reds",
   xlab = "Drought",
   ylab = "Relative Expression",
   errorbar = "std",
   legend.title = "Genotype",
   legend.position = c(0.2, 0.8))


# When using ci as error, increase y.axis.adjust to see the plot correctly!
threeFACTORplot(res,
   arrangement = c(2, 3, 1),
   bar.width = 0.8,
   fill = "Greens",
   xlab = "Drought",
   ylab = "Relative Expression",
   errorbar = "ci",
   y.axis.adjust = 8,
   y.axis.by = 2,
   letter.position.adjust = 0.6,
   legend.title = "Genotype",
   fontsize = 12,
   legend.position = c(0.2, 0.8),
   show.letters = TRUE)
```



# Checking normality of residuals

If the residuals from a `t.test` or a `lm` object are not normaly distributed, the grouping letters (deduced from the `LSD.test`) might be violated. In such cases, one
could apply another data transformation to the wDCt data for ANOVA and mean comparison purposes or use non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney test (also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test), `wilcox.test()`, which is alternative to `t.test`, or the
`kruskal.test()` test which alternative to one-way analysis of variance, to test
the difference between medians of the populations using independent samples.
However, the `t.test` function (along with the `qpcrTTEST` function described
above) include the `var.equal` argument. When set to `FALSE`, performs
`t.test` under unequal variances hypothesis.

```{r eval= T, eval= T, , fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "QQ-plot for the normality assessment of the residuals derived from `t.test` or `lm` functions."}

residualsCRD <- qpcrANOVA(data_3factor_b)$lmCRD$residuals
shapiro.test(residualsCRD) 
qqnorm(residualsCRD)
qqline(residualsCRD, col = "red")
```

# Mean of technical replicates
Calculating the mean of technical replicates and getting an output table appropriate for subsequent ANOVA analysis can be done using `meanTech` function. For this, the input data set should follow column arrangement of the following example data. Grouping columns needs to be specified under the `groups` argument of the `meanTech` function.

```{r eval= T, eval= T}
# See example input data frame:
data_withTechRep

# Calculating mean of technical replicates
meanTech(data_withTechRep, groups = 1:4)
```
