Description: Amplification efficiency estimation, statistical analysis, and graphical representation of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) data using one or more specified reference genes is handled by 'rtpcr' package. By accounting for amplification efficiency values, 'rtpcr' was developed using a general calculation method described by Ganger et al. (2017) <doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1949-5> and Taylor et al. (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.tibtech.2018.12.002>, covering both the Livak and Pfaffl methods. Based on the experimental conditions, the functions of the 'rtpcr' package use t-test (for experiments with a two-level factor), analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or analysis of repeated measure data to analyse the relative expression (Delta Delta Ct method or Delta Ct method). The functions further provide standard errors and confidence intervals for means, apply statistical mean comparisons and present significance.
