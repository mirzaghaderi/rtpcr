# Sample data in (two factor with blocking factor)

A sample qPCR data set with blocking factor. Each line belongs to a
separate individual (non-repeated measure experiment).

## Usage

```

## Format

A data frame with 18 observations and 8 variables:

- factor1:

  First experimental factor

- factor2:

  Second experimental factor

- block:

- Rep:

  Biological replicates

- E_PO:

  Mean amplification efficiency of PO gene

- Ct_PO:

  Ct values of PO gene. Each is the mean of technical replicates
