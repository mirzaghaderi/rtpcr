```

## Format

A data frame with 18 observations and 9 variables:

- factor1:

  experimental factor

- factor2:

  experimental factor

- factor3:

  experimental factor

- biolrep:

- techrep:

  technical replicates

- E_target:

  Amplification efficiency of target gene

- Ct_target:

  Ct of target gene

- E_ref:
