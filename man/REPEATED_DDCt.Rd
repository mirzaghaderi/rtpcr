\usage{
REPEATED_DDCt(
  x,
  NumOfFactors,
  numberOfrefGenes,
  factor,
  calibratorLevel,
  block = NULL,
  x.axis.labels.rename = "none",
  p.adj = "none",
  plot = FALSE,
  analyseAllTarget = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing experimental design columns, target gene
E/Ct column pairs, and reference gene E/Ct column pairs. Reference gene
columns must be located at the end of the data frame.}

\item{NumOfFactors}{Integer. Number of experimental factor columns.}

\item{numberOfrefGenes}{Integer. Number of reference genes. Each reference gene
must be represented by two columns (E and Ct).}

\item{factor}{Character string specifying the factor for which fold changes are analysed
(commonly \code{"time"}).}

\item{calibratorLevel}{A level of \code{factor} to be used as the calibrator (reference level).}

\item{block}{Optional blocking factor column name. If supplied, block effects are treated
as random effects.}

\item{x.axis.labels.rename}{Optional character vector used to replace x-axis labels in the bar plot.}

\item{p.adj}{Method for p-value adjustment.}

\item{plot}{Logical; if \code{FALSE}, plots are not produced.}

\item{analyseAllTarget}{Logical or character.
If \code{TRUE} (default), all detected target genes are analysed.
Alternatively, a character vector specifying the names (names of their Efficiency columns) of target genes
to be analysed.}
}
\value{
A data frame combining DCt method expression tables for all target genes.
The output includes all columns.
}
\description{
Performs Delta-Delta Ct (DCt) analysis for multiple target genes by
applying DCt method to each target gene. Target genes must be provided as paired
efficiency (E) and Ct columns followed by the columns and the reference gene columns.
}
\details{
Column layout requirements for \code{x}:
\itemize{
  \item Target gene columns: E/Ct pairs located between design and reference columns
  \item Reference gene columns: columns located at the end
}
}

  data_repeated_measure_1,
